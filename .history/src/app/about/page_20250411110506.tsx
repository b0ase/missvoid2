              <p className="mb-4">
                For over two decades, Miss Void has been at the forefront of avant-garde fashion, blending the worlds of high fashion and fetish wear into distinctive pieces that challenge conventional boundaries.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Founded in London in 2003 by designer Miss Void and her husband, our atelier has grown from a small workshop in East London to an internationally recognized brand catering to discerning clients across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each piece is meticulously crafted, combining traditional techniques with innovative materials to create wearable art that empowers the wearer and celebrates the beauty of alternative aesthetics.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Philosophy & Approach</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              At Miss Void, we believe that fashion is a powerful form of self-expression. Our designs exist at the intersection of fashion, art, and identity, challenging mainstream conventions while maintaining the highest standards of craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We draw inspiration from BDSM culture, architectural forms, and historical costume, creating pieces that are both provocative and refined. Our work celebrates the beauty of contrastâ€”strength and vulnerability, restriction and freedom, darkness and light.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every garment is created with intention, designed to transform not just how the wearer appears, but how they feel and move through the world.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Global Presence</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              While we are proudly London-based, our clientele spans the globe. Miss Void regularly conducts fittings and consultations in Paris, New York, Dubai, and Shanghai, bringing our unique aesthetic to fashion-forward individuals worldwide.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our pieces have been featured in international fashion publications, worn by celebrities and performers, and showcased in exhibitions celebrating the intersection of fashion and art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite our growth, we remain committed to our core values: exceptional craftsmanship, ethical production, and designs that honor the individuality of each client.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Founders</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Miss Void began her career studying fashion design at Central Saint Martins, where she developed her distinctive aesthetic merging traditional tailoring with unconventional materials and fetish-inspired elements.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Her husband, with a background in fine art and leather craftsmanship, joined the venture in 2005, bringing technical expertise in working with leather, metal, and other specialized materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, they have built Miss Void into a respected name in both mainstream fashion circles and alternative communities, known for pushing boundaries while maintaining impeccable quality and fit.
